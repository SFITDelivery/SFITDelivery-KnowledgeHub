Properly selected metrics for a project allow for accurate and qualitative assessment of the project and its processes, leading to improvements. <br/>
Incorrectly selected metrics, at best, will not help the project, and at worst, will lead to loss of control over the project.<br/>
It is important not to seek a silver bullet or blindly copy others' metrics.<br/>

**This list displays the most commonly encountered basic metrics, their meanings, and areas of application.**
