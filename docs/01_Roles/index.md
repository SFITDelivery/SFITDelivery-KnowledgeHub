# Delivery Manager and DevOps on a Salesforce Project

## Salesforce
Salesforce is a SaaS (Software as a Service) solution. It provides a comprehensive suite of cloud-based applications designed to help businesses manage customer relationships, sales, and marketing more efficiently. As a SaaS platform, Salesforce offers a scalable and flexible solution that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance. This model allows businesses of all sizes to utilize advanced technology and infrastructure without significant upfront investment. Salesforce's services are continuously updated, ensuring that users have access to the latest features and security enhancements.

## Delivery Manager and DevOps Specialist

Salesforce is a SaaS solution, which is why the division into release managers, DevOps specialists, or Delivery Managers on projects, especially small ones, may be absent. Also, combining roles in one position can make sense provided that an effective and resilient CI/CD infrastructure is built.
Merging these roles into a single employee or department will allow for more efficient resource, delivery, and project management.

Both roles on Salesforce projects are responsible for end-to-end processes and are accountable for their:
- Efficiency
- Reliability
- Predictability
- Scalability
- Flexibility

These roles understand which solution is better suited for a specific project considering its size, goals, products, maturity level, and other characteristics.
Delivery Managers and DevOps are responsible for restructuring processes to maintain business flexibility as it grows or changes.

## Service Delivery Manager vs Delivery Manager
The Service Delivery Manager differs from the Delivery Manager in that the Delivery Manager on the project is responsible for the successful completion and delivery of the project, managing the team and resources. The Service Delivery Manager focuses on managing the quality and timely delivery of IT services, interacting with clients, and maintaining SLAs (Service Level Agreements).
Delivery Manager - focuses on the project.
Service Delivery Manager - focuses on long-term service and customer relationships.

## About This Section of the Hub
The description of roles is divided into separate sections:
- [Role: DevOps Specialist](01_01_DevOps/index.md)
- [Role: Delivery Manager](01_02_Delivery_Manager/index.md)

The **Management section** is combined to simplify navigation and so that each company and project can independently define the necessary areas of influence for specialists.
