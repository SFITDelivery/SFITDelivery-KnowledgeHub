Failure to perform regular data backups in Salesforce can lead to serious problems. Since business-critical data is stored in the cloud, any loss or corruption of that data can cause significant damage to an organization. The main risks of not having data backup include:
- **Mass deletion of records** – administrator errors, accidental or intentional deletions.
- **Integration errors** – incorrect API updates can modify or delete important information.
- **System failures** – errors in automated processes (Flows, Workflows) can result in data loss.
- **Cyberattacks and internal threats** – malicious actors can delete or alter data.

To effectively minimize these risks, it is important to choose a tool that meets your project's requirements regarding data structure complexity, backup frequency, and ease of recovery.

## Importance of Choosing the Right Backup Tool
Selecting a backup tool for Salesforce depends on several key factors. Different projects may have varying requirements regarding backup frequency, data structure complexity, and recovery speed. The complexity of creating a reliable system may also justify choosing a third-party solution over developing an in-house tool. It is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each option before making a final decision.

### Data Model Complexity
If data has **many dependencies** (Lookup, Master-Detail), it is essential to choose a tool that **preserves relationships between objects** and restores records in the correct order.

For example, if **Opportunity** is linked to **Account**, and Opportunity has **Related Tasks**, the recovery process should follow a strict sequence:
1. Restore **Accounts** first.
2. Then restore **Opportunities**.
3. Finally, restore **Tasks** to maintain all relationships.

### Backup Frequency
If the system contains critical data, backups should be performed **daily or even hourly**. The built-in [Salesforce Data Export](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.admin_exportdata.htm&type=5) tool allows backups **once a week or month**, which may not be sufficient for dynamic systems. Some solutions support automatic daily backups, while others offer flexible scheduling.

### Data Comparison Before Restoration
Often, it is important not just to restore data but also to **analyze changes** before deletion or corruption occurs. Some solutions offer **data comparison tools** that highlight differences between versions, allowing users to choose the necessary one, whereas other solutions focus on simple restoration without detailed comparison.

### Speed and Ease of Recovery
If lost data needs to be restored quickly, the tool should allow **restoring not just the entire backup but also individual records**. Some tools do not support partial recovery, making it difficult to manage large datasets.

### Scalability and Large Data Volume Support
If a company has **a large amount of data (millions of records)**, it is crucial to consider how the tool handles data processing and storage. Some solutions may have limitations on backup size.

## Methods for Backing Up Salesforce Data
There are several ways to back up Salesforce data. The key selection criteria have been described above. For reference, here are a few tools (but in reality, there are more, and it makes sense to explore other options if you are selecting a metadata backup strategy).

### Built-in Salesforce Tools
#### Salesforce Data Export
Salesforce provides the **Data Export** tool, which allows exporting data as CSV files. This tool supports manual or scheduled exports (weekly or monthly). More details can be found in the [Export Backup Data from Salesforce](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.admin_exportdata.htm&type=5) documentation.

**Advantages:**
- Built-in tool, no additional setup required.
- Available in all Salesforce editions (Enterprise, Unlimited).
- Exports the full data volume.

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited backup frequency (maximum once a week).
- Lack of flexibility in restoration (difficult to restore individual records).

#### SOQL + Data Loader
**Data Loader** is a tool that allows data import/export using **SOQL queries**. It is useful for backing up specific objects or records. Link to [Data Loader](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/data-loader)

Example SOQL query for exporting contacts:

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Email FROM Contact
```

**Advantages:**
- Enables frequent backups (daily, hourly).
- Flexibility: exports only required objects or fields.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires manual setup and automation through scripts.
- Difficult to manually restore data from CSV files.

### Third-party Backup Solutions
When choosing a Salesforce backup tool, it is important to consider key business needs such as backup frequency, recovery speed, ease of use, and cost.

## Backup Frequency
To choose the right backup strategy, analyze project specifics and assess data, including:
- Categorizing data by business/project criticality.
- Evaluating data volume and backup duration.
- Determining necessary backup frequency for each data type.

Based on this assessment, configure appropriate backup frequency:
- **Hourly/every few hours:** For mission-critical, frequently changing data (e.g., financial institutions, e-commerce platforms).
- **Daily:** For important data that changes regularly.
- **Weekly:** Full data and metadata export.
- **Before major changes:** Before data imports, API updates, database schema modifications, or new app installations.

## Recommendations
- Develop a backup plan tailored to your organization's needs.
- Select the most suitable tool for your specific case; familiar solutions may not be optimal for new projects or changing conditions.
- Regularly test both the backup process and data restoration procedures to ensure the system functions correctly and business operations can resume quickly after failures.
- Store backups securely, separate from the primary system.
- Automate the process where possible.

Ensure the selected tool provides reliable data encryption during storage and transmission and complies with security standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2).

## Conclusion
Salesforce data backup is a crucial part of data management strategy. Choosing the right method and performing regular backups will help protect your organization from potential data loss and ensure business continuity.
