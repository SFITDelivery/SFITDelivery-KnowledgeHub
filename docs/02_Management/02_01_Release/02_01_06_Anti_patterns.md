1. **Lack of Unified Release Planning**: Teams plan and execute releases independently without a unified roadmap or coordination.

2. **Ignoring Risk Assessment**: Release planning is done without proper risk assessment or preparation for potential issues.

3. **Inadequate Incident Response Preparation**: The team lacks a well-defined process for handling incidents, especially critical ones that require urgent attention.

4. **Over-Reliance on Manual Processes**: Key processes, including testing and deployment, rely heavily on manual steps rather than automation.

5. **Poor Dependency Management**: Dependencies between different teams and components are not properly managed or communicated.

6. **Frequent and Uncontrolled Releases**: Releasing updates too frequently without sufficient testing or oversight, often driven by the pressure to deliver features quickly.

7. **Insufficient Communication Between Teams**: Development teams work in silos with minimal communication, leading to misalignment and duplicated efforts.

8. **Failure to Adapt to Project-Specific Needs**: Applying a one-size-fits-all release management strategy without considering the specific needs of the project or team.
