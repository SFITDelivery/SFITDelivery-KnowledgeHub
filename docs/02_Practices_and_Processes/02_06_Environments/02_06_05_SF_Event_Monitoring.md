Salesforce handles vast amounts of data and user activity, making it crucial to understand **what's happening within the system**. Without proper oversight, administrators might overlook critical incidents, such as:

- **Unusual User Activity** – bulk logins, hacking attempts, large data downloads.
- **Integration and Automation Errors** – API request failures, unexpected transaction rollbacks.
- **Performance Degradation** – slow queries, delayed reports, slow-loading pages.
- **Unauthorized Data Changes** – bulk updates or deletions of records.

## Event Monitoring
To minimize these risks, Salesforce offers [**Event Monitoring**](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/using_resources_event_log_files.htm), enabling administrators and security specialists to collect, store, and analyze user, admin, and integration process activities. This tool allows organizations to track critical activities, identify anomalies, and respond promptly.

**Event Monitoring tracks events such as:**
- Viewing or exporting reports and data (Report Exports)
- Authentication and login attempts (Login Events)
- Data modifications (Data Changes)
- Usage of REST, SOAP, and Bulk APIs (API Requests)
- Lightning page performance (Lightning Performance Events)

All events are logged into **Event Log Files**, which can be exported and analyzed. Note that these logs are stored temporarily: 30 days by default, though this can be extended for Event Monitoring Analytics subscribers. In Developer Edition environments, logs are stored for only 1 day.

## Real-Time Event Monitoring
Besides standard **Event Monitoring**, Salesforce also provides [**Real-Time Event Monitoring**](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.real_time_event_monitoring_overview.htm&type=5), allowing real-time event tracking and automation setup based on these events. Real-Time Event Monitoring is crucial for ensuring reliability and security, enabling rapid responses to incidents.

**Real-Time Event Monitoring Supports:**
- **Automatic alerts** for anomaly detection.
- **Event handling via Streaming API** (integratable with SIEM systems like Splunk, QRadar, ELK, etc.).
- **Creating Transaction Security Policies** to automatically block suspicious actions.

**Real-Time Event Monitoring Examples:**
- **Intrusion Detection** – identifying a single user logging in from multiple countries.
- **Tracking Data Downloads** – administrator downloading a large volume of files quickly.
- **Attack Response** – high volume of API requests within a short time.

**Important:** Real-Time Event Monitoring is available exclusively through **Salesforce Shield**.

Salesforce provides relevant Trailheads:
- [Event Monitoring | Salesforce Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/event_monitoring)
- [Real-Time Event Monitoring | Salesforce Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/realtime-event-monitoring)

## Usage of Event Monitoring
Export Logs via API and Salesforce UI
Finding Event Monitoring Logs:
- Navigate to **Setup -> Event Log File Browser**
- Select desired events and download CSV reports

Automatic export using Salesforce CLI:
```bash
sf data query -o my-org -q "SELECT EventType, LogDate FROM EventLogFile"
```

## Set Up Automatic Alerts and Real-Time Monitoring
With **Real-Time Event Monitoring**, automated responses to events can be configured.

Transaction Security Policy Example:
- Go to **Setup -> Transaction Security Policies**
- Choose rule creation method: **Clicks or Code?** (visual Condition Builder or Apex code)
- Create a **rule** (e.g., "Block downloads exceeding 1000 records at once")
- Set up an **action**: alert an admin or block the action

## Event Monitoring Best Practices
- **Regularly check Event Log Files**, especially after releases, updates, or integration changes.
- **Set up automatic alerts** to respond swiftly to potential threats.
- **Leverage Real-Time Event Monitoring** for rapid detection of attacks and anomalies.
- **Integrate with SIEM systems** for comprehensive log analysis and storage.

## Conclusion
Event Monitoring and Real-Time Event Monitoring in Salesforce are vital components of maintaining security, performance, and stability. Regular event analysis and quick responses to suspicious activities enable companies to effectively prevent risks, quickly detect and resolve issues, and ensure high standards of data protection and regulatory compliance.
