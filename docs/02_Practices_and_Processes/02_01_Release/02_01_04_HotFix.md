### What is a Hotfix?

A hotfix is an urgent fix for a critical error that has occurred in production and requires immediate resolution. Unlike planned releases, a hotfix is implemented without prior long-term planning and preparation, making the process riskier. However, with proper organization and adherence to a clear plan, a hotfix can be deployed quickly and safely.

### Key Stages of Managing a Hotfix

#### 1. Assessing and Classifying the Problem

The first step in the hotfix process is to assess and classify the problem. It is necessary to determine how critical the error is and whether it requires immediate intervention. A unified system for tracking, prioritizing, and managing issues should be established within the project.

**Key questions for assessment:**

- **Impact on business:** How severely does the error affect key business processes? Could it lead to significant financial losses or operational disruptions?
- **Number of affected users:** How many users are affected by this issue? Is it an isolated incident or a widespread problem?
- **Availability of a workaround:** Is there a temporary solution that can mitigate the issue until a permanent fix is implemented?

#### 2. Rapid Development and Testing of the Fix

Once the problem is classified, the team must promptly start developing the fix. It is important to minimize the time spent on this stage while ensuring the quality of the solution.

**Steps for development and testing:**

- **Isolated development environment:** The hotfix should be developed in an isolated environment to avoid impacting other changes or ongoing developments.
- **Minimization of changes:** The changes should be minimal to reduce the risk of introducing new errors.
- **Testing:** Despite the urgency, it is crucial to conduct all possible tests in a sandbox environment. Automated and regression testing helps identify potential issues early.
- **Use of a production-like environment:** The hotfix should be tested in an environment that closely resembles the production environment.

#### 3. Deploying the Hotfix to Production

When the fix is ready and has passed testing, the next step is deploying it to production. This process requires precise coordination and attention to details.

**Steps for deployment:**

- **Rollback strategy:** Before deploying the hotfix, it is important to have a strategy in place for quickly rolling back the changes if unforeseen problems arise.
- **Notifying stakeholders:** All key participants should be informed about the upcoming deployment to ensure that stakeholders are prepared for potential system instability.
- **Gradual deployment:** Depending on the complexity of the fix, it may be beneficial to deploy it gradually or on a limited scale (e.g., using Canary Releases) to ensure stability.

#### 4. Monitoring and Evaluating Results

After the hotfix is deployed, it is important to closely monitor the system and evaluate the results of the fix.

**Key actions:**

- **System monitoring:** Use monitoring tools to track system performance and key metrics. Any deviations from the norm should be analyzed immediately.
- **Collecting user feedback:** Promptly gather feedback from users to ensure that the issue is resolved and no new problems have arisen.
- **Incident analysis:** After the system stabilizes, conduct an analysis of the incident to identify the root cause and determine how to prevent similar situations in the future.

### How to Minimize Risks When Implementing a Hotfix

Hotfixes always carry certain risks, but proper organization of the process can significantly reduce them.

#### 1. Preparing for Potential Problems

- **Rollback plan:** Develop a rollback strategy to quickly restore the system to its previous stable state if problems arise.
- **Failure procedures:** Developing and documenting procedures for handling failures during the hotfix deployment is an important part of the hotfix process.

#### 2. Automating Processes

- **Automated testing:** Using automated tests helps reduce testing time and improve its quality.
- **CI/CD processes:** Integrating the hotfix into CI/CD processes allows for automated deployment and minimizes the likelihood of errors.
- **Git strategy:** It is important that the Git strategy accommodates the possibility of conducting hotfixes in the most efficient way that meets the project’s requirements. [Hotfix Git strategy](../02_02_Git/02_02_09_HotFix.md).

#### 3. Regular Drills and Training

- **Training deployments:** Regularly conduct hotfix drills in a test environment to ensure the team is prepared to act quickly in a real situation.
- **Documentation and training:** Ensure that the entire team is familiar with the hotfix management processes and has access to the necessary documentation and tools. It is important to keep the documentation up to date.

### Conclusion

Managing hotfixes is a complex but crucial aspect of release management in Salesforce projects. Prompt and safe deployment of urgent fixes requires careful planning, quality testing, and diligent monitoring. By following the steps and recommendations outlined above, you can minimize risks, quickly resolve critical issues, and maintain the stability of your Salesforce system. A well-structured hotfix process and strategy aligned with the project’s conditions contribute to the overall resilience of the system in the long term.
