# The Role of a Delivery Manager

A Delivery Manager is a data-driven change manager responsible for the end-to-end process of delivering the final product to the user. They reduce the time from idea to market launch and increase predictability. If there's no request for an end-to-end process, they are responsible for the entire available chain.

It's important not to confuse the Delivery Manager role with other professions like Service Delivery Manager, Scrum Master, or Agile Coach. Even individually, these roles do not fully characterize the role of a Delivery Manager.

## Why a Delivery Manager is Needed

- Accelerating product delivery to the market amidst increasing complexity in IT systems, processes, and products.
- Reassembling and improving processes of a growing or changing business, ensuring that companies maintain agility and efficiency while scaling.
- Accumulating and sharing practices and experiences with the organization, teams, employees, and the community.

## What a Delivery Manager Does

The tasks of a Delivery Manager are divided into two groups: change management and scalability of practices.

- **Change Management**
- **Scalability of Practices**

## How a Delivery Manager Works

To accomplish their tasks, a Delivery Manager plays three roles: owner of the production process, change manager, and coach.

### The Owner of the Production Process

As the "Production Process" Product Owner, they work on delivering the product from idea to user receipt, building horizontal and vertical partnerships among all value creators. They visualize processes to make them understandable and manageable, work on improving Discovery and Delivery metrics, and form a transparent strategy for the development plans of production processes considering company goals.

### The Change Agent

As a Change Agent, they manage changes using management tools, engage people in a common cause. They scale processes and working practices to maintain company flexibility and work with metrics using a data-driven approach. They assist teams in maintaining a level of awareness that enables them to independently improve processes.

### The Coach

As a Coach, they help teams resolve conflicts and reach optimal solutions using facilitation tools. They accumulate knowledge and practices, adapt them to the context, and share them with colleagues. Coaches also maintain a proactive stance in people's participation in the life of the company and its processes, invest in training and development through coaching and mentoring practices. They assist in creating individual development plans for specialists and processes.
