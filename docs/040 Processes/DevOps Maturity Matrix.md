# DevOps Maturity Matrix

## What Is It?

The DevOps Maturity Matrix is a framework that helps organizations assess their current state in the DevOps domain and develop a growth plan. This matrix typically includes several levels of maturity, ranging from initial stages (e.g., traditional development processes) to optimized stages(where DevOps is fully integrated into the company's culture and processes).

## Why Is It Needed?

The DevOps Maturity Matrix is essential for:

1. **Determining the current level:** Assessing the organization's position in its DevOps transformation journey.
2. **Planning for Improvements:** Creating a roadmap for improving processes, tools, and practices.
3. **Identifying Gaps:** Identifying areas that require improvement or development.
4. **Improving Product Quality:** Guaranteeing higher-quality and more rapid software releases.
5. **Motivating the Team:** Offering a clear developmental path that encourages team progression.

## How to Create It?

Developing a DevOps Maturity Matrix involves:

1. **Defining Target Parameters:** Selection of key DevOps aspects, such as automation, culture, measurement, and collaboration.
2. **Setting Maturity Levels:** Defining various maturity levels for each parameter, typically from 1 to 5.
3. **Developing Assessment Criteria:** Establishing criteria for each level of maturity. Criteria should contain an explicit and complete description of acceptance criteria and what must be done. The benefit for the organization/project should be described.
4. **Including Examples and Recommendations:** Adding practical examples and recommendations for achieving each level.
5. **Determining Dependencies:** Indicating dependencies between different categories and levels.

The creation of the matrix requires the participation of representatives from all teams involved in the delivery processes, such as Developers, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, QA, and others. Forming a **transformation team** is advisable.

## How Is It Maintained?

Maintaining the DevOps Maturity Matrix includes:

1. **Regular Assessment:** Conducting periodic evaluations to ascertain the organization's current maturity level.
2. **Planning Improvements:** Outlining and organizing initiatives to advance to higher levels, specifying time frames like quarters or months.
3. **Tracking Progress:** Monitoring changes and improvements in DevOps processes and compiling a report for the specified time frames with an explanation of the final results, conclusions, and recommendations.
4. **Updating the Matrix:** Regularly updating the matrix to reflect changes in the industry and within the organization or project.

The DevOps Maturity Matrix is a dynamic document that needs to constantly evolve to align with the organization's shifting objectives and conditions. It is a valuable tool for understanding and directing the evolution of DevOps practices in the company.
