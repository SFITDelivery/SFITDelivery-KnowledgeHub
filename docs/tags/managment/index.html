If the system is damaged due to human error, a failed release, or an incorrect update, restoring it to a functional state can be difficult or even impossible without a backup. The loss of critical configuration data, such as object settings, business logic, or security rules, can significantly disrupt an entire company and result in substantial reputational and financial losses.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_02_Git/02_02_07_Org_Branch"><h2>Org Branch</h2></a><p>The Git Org Branch Strategy, where each branch corresponds to a specific environment (e.g., development, UAT, staging, production), is a useful concept for managing changes and deployments in corporate and large projects. This strategy is common in Salesforce projects due to licensing policies and environment setups that may not allow for full testing environments and limited use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approaches.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_02_Git/02_02_05_Parallel_Releases"><h2>Parallel Releases</h2></a><p>The Parallel Release Git strategy allows managing multiple versions of a product simultaneously. Separate release branches (release-x.x) are created for each release, enabling the preparation and testing of different product versions in parallel. Feature branches can be created from release-x.x branches, which serve as develop branches for the corresponding releases. This approach helps isolate changes and manage multiple product versions simultaneously, which is especially useful for projects with long development cycles and support for older versions. However, it requires strict branch management and synchronization of changes. An important feature is the designation of major and minor releases for their sequential synchronization.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_04_Delivery_Strategies/02_04_02_Phased_Rollouts"><h2>Phased Rollouts</h2></a><p>Phased Rollouts, or phased deployment, is a general term that describes strategies for implementing changes through gradual scaling. In this approach, new features or updates are introduced to specific groups of users or environments to minimize risks and manage workload effectively.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_03_Salesforce_Deployment/02_03_06_Quick_Deployment"><h2>Quick Deploy</h2></a><p>Quick Deploy is a Salesforce feature that speeds up the deployment process if validation with necessary test (unit tests) execution has been successfully completed beforehand. Quick Deploy is useful in situations where deployment needs to be performed at a specific time, minimizing the cost of re-testing, as testing was completed during validation. This method enables preparation for deployment in advance by validating changes, allowing deployment within a specific time window (e.g., to minimize business disruption or synchronize deployment with other events).</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_01_Release/02_01_01_Release_Management"><h2>Release Management</h2></a><p>In today’s environment, businesses demand flexibility, speed, and precision from IT departments when implementing new features and updates.

Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the project’s current goals and CI/CD strategy.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_06_Environments/02_06_04_SF_System_Overview"><h2>System Overview</h2></a><p>Salesforce operates in the cloud and uses distributed computing, which imposes restrictions on resource consumption. Efficient management of system resources in solutions like Salesforce is critically important. Without resource management, system stability will eventually be compromised, leading to critical errors that can have serious consequences for the business.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_03_Salesforce_Deployment/02_03_09_Test_Coverage_Matrix"><h2>Test Coverage Matrix</h2></a><p>The Test Coverage Matrix is a tool that tracks the relationship between test classes and the classes they cover, along with additional information such as coverage percentage, the date of the last test run, and comments. It is a vital tool for managing code quality, providing simplified access to test coverage data, and enabling change tracking.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_02_Git/02_02_02_TBD"><h2>Trunk-Based Development (TBD)</h2></a><p>The Trunk-Based Development (TBD) strategy is applied in projects where the main values are release frequency and speed. It is characterized by frequent commits and merges into a single main branch. If feature branches are used, they exist for no longer than a few days or hours. Under this strategy, the main branch is always ready for deployment to production, although release branches may also be used. This approach is more often used in small teams due to the need for close interaction and good communication among developers, clear process organization, and discipline.</p></article><article class="margin-vert--lg"><a href="/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_03_Salesforce_Deployment/02_03_07_Packages"><h2>Types of Packages in Salesforce</h2></a><p>Unlocked Package — used for modular development, allowing developers to update, modify, and version packages for dependency management.
