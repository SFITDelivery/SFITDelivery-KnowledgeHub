It is characterized by frequent commits and merges into a single main branch. If feature branches are used, they exist for no longer than a few days or hours. Under this strategy, the main branch is always ready for deployment to production, although release branches may also be used. This approach is more often used in small teams due to the need for close interaction and good communication among developers, clear process organization, and discipline.","permalink":"/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_02_Git/02_02_02_TBD"}],"unlisted":false}')}}]);
