Choosing the right approach for test execution helps optimize time and resource costs while minimizing risks associated with potential errors. This article examines two main approaches to test execution during deployment: running all tests (RunLocalTests) and running specific tests (RunSpecifiedTests). Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the project\u2019s current goals and CI/CD strategy.","permalink":"/SFITDelivery-KnowledgeHub/docs/Management/02_03_Deployment/02_03_04_Run_Tests_for_Deployment"},{"id":"Management/02_03_Deployment/02_03_09_Test_Coverage_Matrix","title":"Test Coverage Matrix","description":"The Test Coverage Matrix is a tool that tracks the relationship between test classes and the classes they cover, along with additional information such as coverage percentage, the date of the last test run, and comments.
