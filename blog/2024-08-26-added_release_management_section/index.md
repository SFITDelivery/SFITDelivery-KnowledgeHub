Basic articles have been added to the [release management section](/docs/category/release).  
The articles contain information on methodology and practical advice on release management, with a separate note dedicated to [HotFix](/docs/Management/02_01_Release/02_01_04_HotFix). [Anti-patterns](/docs/Management/02_01_Release/02_01_06_Anti_patterns) can help conduct a quick, superficial review of the project's release management processes, allowing for the identification of common mistakes and shortcomings.
