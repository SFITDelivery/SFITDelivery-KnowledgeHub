            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DevOps and Delivery practices are underdeveloped in Salesforce projects.
Small projects often do not integrate these roles with the existing ones on the project, such as developers.
Large projects turn to off-the-shelf products.
All of this leads to suboptimal solutions, or pitfalls laid at the foundation of the project.</p>
<p>This resource is created for sharing and accumulating experience and best DevOps and Delivery practices within Salesforce and cross-projects.
Here, you will find documentation and technical solutions.</p>
<p>Please feel free to propose your changes/solutions/edits - this is an open project.</p>
<p>Let's make this world a better place!</p>]]></content:encoded>
